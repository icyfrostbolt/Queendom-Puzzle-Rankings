# Introduction

Why was this show chosen? Due to all artists being established, they have a fanbase, which could play into the results. On survival shows where aspiring trainees are trying to debut, many trainees are unknown which means that they don't have any influence from before the show starting.

The format of the show also makes it better than other shows for analysis, due to the outcomes of the contestants being evenly divided, with 7 people eliminated or debuting during each phase. The question this analysis asks how does the various factors of a group/artist affect their placement on Queendom Puzzle?

# Creating a model

To analyze popularity, I will use the ranks given on the first episode of the show that were based on their prior career experience in the industry. This is a fair metric of popularity to compare, except for the fact that Fye and Miru are ranked low as they have no K-pop experience, despite having a fanbase outside of it which could influence the votes.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}

summarized_data <- QP_Ranking %>%
                   group_by(name)
summarized_split <- initial_split(summarized_data, prop = 0.75, strata = initial_rank)

summarized_training <- training(summarized_split)
summarized_testing <- testing(summarized_split)
```
